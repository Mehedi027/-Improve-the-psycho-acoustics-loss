Improve the psycho-acoustics loss function based on sub-bands analysis and computation.

The psycho-acoustic loss function built on the sub-band analysis applies measures to audio
differences in a more relevant perceptual manner. In computing loss values, this methodâ€™s
incorporation of focal weighting at the sub-band level makes for more accurate assessment
of human hearing compared to the conventional way. The findings show differences in the
impact of different distorting effects on different frequency bands underscoring the need for
evaluating loss in a frequency-dependent manner. On the other hand, this approach does not
account for temporal masking which is an important component of perception in
psychoacoustics.
